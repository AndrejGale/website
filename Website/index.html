    <div class="aboutmetxt">
      <p>Hi! My name is Andrej, and I’m a 14-year-old student from the country of North Macedonia.</p>
      <p>Recently, I discovered my passion for programming in JavaScript and coding in general. I love creating projects, solving problems, and learning new technologies.</p>
      <p>Even though I’m just starting, I’m excited about the endless possibilities that programming offers and can’t wait to see how I can use my skills to make an impact.</p>
      <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new hobbies, spending time with friends, or dreaming up my next project.</p>
    </div>

    <h1 class="siteinfo">What is this site for?</h1>
    <div class="siteinfotxt">
      <p>So, what is this website even for?</p>
      <p>I want to make this website my personal hub where you can see all of my accomplishments, skills, games and much more!</p>
      <p>This site is made entirely by me with the things that i have learned over the course of my entire coding journey!</p>
      <p>Also, i made this website to help me when it comes to getting a job over the next couple of years.</p>
      <p>All in all, i made this site so i can keep track of my accomplishments while also you can also check out some of the things i made!</p>
      <p>Why dont you go and check them out?</p>
